The first leg on Sunday 25th November 2018 (Manchester -Dubai) was excellent, the crew were attentive and very pleasant. The next leg (Dubai-Singapore) was less pleasant the crew less attentive. The return flights (8th December)were much more unpleasant the aircraft was full on both legs but that should not have had any bearing on the complete lack of interest that the crew displayed. On the first leg my wife felt as though she was about to vomit, I went with her to the back of the plane and asked a member of the crew for some advice (He was chatting to two other crew members at the time) his response was to point to a toilet at the rear and said â€œSick bags in the restroomâ€ no other concern was expressed. The leg from Dubai to Manchester was over night leaving Dubai at 2.55am for at least three hours we saw no crew at all, anything we needed had to be requested by a visit to the curtained off galley. Overall we were extremely disappointed by the standard of service, far less than we expected. The uniforms of the crew are probably the smartest in the business but along with this must go an equivalent level of customer service. This was our first trip with Emirates but I expected far more from them than this. Good clean aircraft, food only so-so, good timekeeping but oh dear! The level of service fell far below what should be a standard.","output": "Y" },

The A380 on the Dubai-Birmingham leg had more leg room. It was A380s on the return journey to Melbourne. Having heard people rate Emirates I was so disappointed. Each flight was late (by about an hour each time) departing. The cabin service was poor. We were offered one alcoholic drink for the whole of a 14 hour flight. The food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons I couldn't eat anything that the airports offered. If the baggage locker over your seat row was full you had to find space somewhere else which could be several rows back. The cabin crew refused to help. So no I never want to use this airline again.

Dinner was served not too late after departure so that we could settle in for a good sleep. The meal options and wine offerings were again fantastic. For those still feeling hungry, there were additional options of warm and cold snacks available and prepared throughout the flight by the crew. Also, there were plenty of hors d'oeuvres on offer at the bar. The brilliant inflight entertainment system helped to ease any boredom on this long flight. Given the length of the flight, we arrived well ahead of schedule in Dubai.","output": "Y" },

We have never had such an ordeal with any company we have done business with. Customers for 15 years and that doesn't make a bit of difference. Such a shame. We have had to take matters into our own hands. I know this is actually a huge problem with American Airlines and having miles stolen as I have heard similar stories.

They were leaving the airport within minutes if boarding time. The gate attendants made their frustrations pretty clear.

Even worse, this delay was because the flight attendants had â€œrequiredâ€ rest from a three hour delay the night prior. They could not begin the shift and we cannot board without them. If this was known in advance, why was the flight not delayed or alternate attendants provided? The gate ladies were livid at the lack of communication by AA. I nearly missed my connection. On my second flight, there were mechanical issues. This was announced after the left the gate and we had to turn around. We were stuck in the plane. Even worse- I was in the back row next to the toilet (which was being frequently used with the delay) and the woman in front of me was sick. She was sneezing, coughing, blowing her nose. The couple next to me moved To the other side of the plane. There were 10+ Empty middle seats on the plane. I said I was afraid of getting sick and sensitive to the smell of the toilet.

They changed the plane to a B757 a few weeks after my booking so in the end my flight was operated by a glorious aircraft from the '80s with extremely wide but hard seats with limited recline capability. Because of a technical issue, departure was delayed for about one hour (this happened in about 40% of all the flights I had with AA so far, kind of disturbing if you compare with other major airlines) but no big deal as I was not in a hurry. No PTV on the seat just the old fashioned hanging monitor with terrible sound and video quality, so bad they even had to interrupt the safety video because it was a torture for our ears. Flight was uneventful with a pleasant purser who greeted passengers one by one by shaking their hands both upon boarding and before landing. I did not feel like eating so did not try the meal which did look fine by the way (chicken with some vegetables).

Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals.","output": "N" },

A crew member got sick - which you would think is a regular enough occurrence that they would have a plan for dealing with that. But apparently their best back-up plan was to fly in a whole other plane 4 hours later - and then getting that off the ground 30 minutes late. No concern whatsoever for timeliness. And this is pretty typical, today was just particularly atrocious.","output": "N" },

Boeing 777 is a great aircraft, the economy seats seem to be less cramped and overall flying experience is nice. Flight from DFW to YVR also on time, and the flight was full of people coughing and sneezing. I thought for sure I would get sick, but I didnt. That's obviously not the fault of the airline! The airline staff pleasant. I got what I paid for, a basic flight that took off and landed on time, all luggage arrived, no issues or problems.","output": "N" },

ATC Delay in Miami (didn't tell us why but probably weather) not AA fault. Our aircraft left Miami for St Thomas returned due to medical emergency not AA fault. Aircraft arrived St Thomas and we departed 7.40pm (instead of 2.58pm) not AA fault. Arrived Miami and after 3 hours standing in line because in spite of knowing the flight was delayed four hours no one checked hotel room availability. We received meal vouchers for dinner ($12 and the restaurants were closed) voucher for hotel room (received at 2am waited 35 minutes for a van to a Holiday Inn had to be back at 5 to take advantage of the breakfast voucher $6 before the 7.14am flight to Dallas). Try to buy dinner for $12 or breakfast for $6 at Miami international. While we were in line no movement for over an hour because no one had checked room availability. Two attendants initially handling the entire rebooking for the flight. After over an hour another showed up at an adjacent gate. Shortly 'Denise' decided it was time for her to leave. She was 'supposed to leave twenty minutes ago. Extremely poor planning overall. Poor accommodation after the fact. This is becoming the typical customer service quality for American and is really disappointing.","output": "N" },

Departed from Dublin on time and landed thirty minutes early in New York JFK. Cabin crew was bit rude toward an elderly passenger who was not able to lift her own cabin bag and fit it into the overhead compartment. Cabin Crew said that insurance wold not cover her sick leaves if she get injured by lifting the bag. Breakfast was very poor - only a really hard bread with cheese and a frozen orange juice with yogurt. Ticket was really cheap and my experience was good with Delta. I will fly with them again but the crew should be more polite and kind to passengers.","output": "N" },

Return Jan 7th 2015. First leg of the flight came in late so we missed our connecting flight. They scheduled everyone who missed the connection on the same flight a few hours later ensuring it was busting to capacity. No seats unused. Even though I get airsick and need to be next to the window they refused to accommodate-even though I'd paid more for a window seat on the flight their delay made me miss. Then later delayed on the runway 4 hours-apparently because they were waiting for a manifest. The seats were just atrocious. I've flown economy all my life and never felt so uncomfortable. I will do anything to never have to fly this airline again.","output": "Y" },
