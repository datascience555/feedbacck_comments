    "input": " Trip Verified | London to Izmir via Istanbul First time Id flown TK I found them very good in the air cabin crew planes food all very nice Not so great on the ground ground staff call centre computer systems My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul Most ground staff dont speak English and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later but it wasnt an easy process made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport Also Id phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra 40 or so each way for extra leg room seats However as the departure times kept changing my seats kept changing and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out Overall I think their cabin crew and planes are very good ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with",

    "input": " Trip Verified | Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul I flew with this company several times in the past years and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish) The ground staff is for the most part useless In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer was: Relax Sir No problem Sir It's okay The new airport is a gigantic mess very big and disorganized When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking it's an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport they all chat between each other some with a coffee in their hands I flew with four different aircraft on this trip two were fairly new the other two were old seats worn Food on board was of very poor quality let me repeat this verypoor quality In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good while ground personnel especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy A complete disaster I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay If you are in a hurry or you know you will be avoid this company and avoid the new istanbul airport at all costs",
