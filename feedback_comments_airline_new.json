Not so great on the ground, ground staff, call centre, computer systems. My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff donâ€™t speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later, but it wasnâ€™t an easy process, made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also, Iâ€™d phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra Â£40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall, I think their cabin crew and planes are very good, ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.""output": "N" },

I flew with this company several times in the past years, and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse. I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul, all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish). The ground staff is for the most part useless. In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer was: "Relax Sir, No problem Sir, It's okay". The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it's an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy. A complete disaster. I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future, it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay. If you are in a hurry or you know you will be avoid this company and avoid the new istanbul airport at all costs.""output": "N" },

Turkish Airlines has consistently maintained its quality since I first flew with them in 2007. The flights leave on time, the catering is excellent, the inflight entertainment is extensive and the interface easy to use, and the cabin crew is excellent. Interesting though the A330 on the KHI-IST route and return seemed to have more leg room and was newer than the A330 on the IAD-IST route which was showing its age. The A330 on the IAD-IST route had a slow responding interface for the inflight entertainment and a broken table on the return flight. But Turkish Airlines will be replacing the A330 on its flight to IAD with the 787 sometime in the summer. Turkish food was served on the return leg which I personally like, and I saw the cabin staff helping elderly passengers walk to the lavatory which was nice. Overall another wonderful experience with Turkish Airlines.""output": "N" },

I have no leg, I move on a prosthesis. The choice of a comfortable place is important for my sick leg. When I flying from Hurghada â€“ at the reception manager not given our pre-selected seats. He give to me uncomfortable seats in the tail of the aircraft, although I chose a seats for 4 months before departure. Turkish Airlines does not have Internet check-in when passengers departing from Hurghada. At the check-in Desk, the Manager issues boarding passes at random, not paying attention to the pre-selected seats in our tickets. 2. Indifference flight attendants In the plane, I ask for 2 flight attendants and explained the essence of the problem, said about my disability, showed my ticket. The flight attendants answered me: â€œThe plane is full. I can't help you, sorryâ€ The flight attendants were absolutely indifferent to my problems, they did not want to help me. 3. Stuff indifference at Ataturk Airport. Upon arrival in Istanbul, I had a connection time at the airport: 3: 20 - with our next flight to Vnukovo, Moscow. I was very tired, I had a pain in my leg, and I turned to the Info desk to ask the managers to let me rest for a short time in the lounges of Turkish Airlines. I said that I was disabled, I asked for help. In response, I received complete indifference, unwillingness to help me. The manager refused me any help, despite my repeated requests for help. I have not seen anywhere such a bad attitude, indifference to the disabled person in my air travels! 3. Problem with pre-ordered special meals When I buying tickets, my wife and I ordered Bland meal (BLML) and Diabetic meal (DBML) We always order in flights these types of food for our medical reasons. In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights â€“ in two ways! I remember that in my meal there was a lot of fiber, which I cannot eat. This is incompatible with the concept of the Bland meal (BLML) diet.""output": "Y" },

Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment.  This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the â€œTransferâ€ station where we can request to be booked to another flight.  We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they donâ€™t give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wifeâ€™s US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind.  We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers. For the next 24 hours, we were prisoners in Istanbul airport. I regret my decision to fly Turkish and I will never fly them again.""output": "N" },

My light was turned off both times and I was ignored each time. I felt sick the entire flight because I needed water desperately. Cabin crew were not very friendly and seemed quite stressed out.

On my second flight, there were mechanical issues. This was announced after the left the gate and we had to turn around. We were stuck in the plane. Even worse- I was in the back row next to the toilet (which was being frequently used with the delay) and the woman in front of me was sick. She was sneezing, coughing, blowing her nose.

They changed the plane to a B757 a few weeks after my booking so in the end my flight was operated by a glorious aircraft from the '80s with extremely wide but hard seats with limited recline capability. Because of a technical issue, departure was delayed for about one hour (this happened in about 40% of all the flights I had with AA so far, kind of disturbing if you compare with other major airlines) but no big deal as I was not in a hurry. No PTV on the seat just the old fashioned hanging monitor with terrible sound and video quality, so bad they even had to interrupt the safety video because it was a torture for our ears. Flight was uneventful with a pleasant purser who greeted passengers one by one by shaking their hands both upon boarding and before landing. I did not feel like eating so did not try the meal which did look fine by the way (chicken with some vegetables).

I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality.
